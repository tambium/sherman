# Todo list

This example models a set of local nodes that can independently add todo list items. If a note `isOnline: bool` we expect it to share updates of its todo list with a central authority for syncing.

### Running the example

We use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to spin up a development server quickly.

```bash
cd examples/todo-list
yarn && yarn start
```

Open [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234/).
